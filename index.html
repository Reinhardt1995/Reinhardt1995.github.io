<p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 18/11/1995</p>
<p><strong>Current Occupation:</strong> Graduate Intern</p>
<p><strong>Highest Qualification:</strong> BSocSci (Honours) Philosophy, Politics and Economics</p>
<p><strong>Profile:</strong> I am someone who values being challenged because being reminded what you're</p>
<p> capable of is, at least to me, the greatest reward one can recieve for their efforts. I am passionate</p>
<p> about challenging and/or reframing traditional beliefs or orthodox ways of thinking as well as building</p> 
<p>relationships with those that have a similar interest.To avoid being hypocritcal in some sense, I find </p>
<p>myself having to learn and unlearn continuously and, in a way,this has undoubtedly become the aspect  </p> 
<p> of my early career that I am most enamoured by.</p>
